Privacy Policy for Jain Silver Plaza Mobile App

Last updated: November 28, 2025

Introduction

Jain Silver Plaza ("we", "us" or "our") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect through our mobile app and backend services, why we collect it, how we use and protect it, and your rights. This policy applies to data collected via the Jain Silver mobile app and our backend API endpoints (the "Service").

If you are submitting the app to Google Play, include a link to this privacy policy in the Play Console and host this document at a public HTTPS URL (for example: https://your-domain/privacy).

1. Information We Collect

1.1 Information You Provide Directly
- Account / Profile data: name, email address, phone number, profile photo.
- KYC / documents: identity documents (Aadhar, PAN), document photos, and numbers if required by law.
- Messages and support requests you send to us.
- Payments / order details when making purchases: billing name, address, order items. (We may use third-party payment processors — see Third Parties.)

1.2 Automatically Collected Information
- Device and usage data: IP address, device identifiers, OS version, app version, and analytics/logs to improve performance and reliability.
- Real-time rates: the app fetches silver rates from third-party vendors and we may collect and cache these rate values to serve users.

1.3 Third-Party Data Sources
- We may obtain information from third-party services you choose to connect (for example, identity verification, payment providers) to the extent you consent.

2. How We Use Your Data

We use collected data for the following purposes:
- Provide and maintain the Service (authentication, user profiles, rate updates).
- Process orders and payments, and send transactional communications (invoices, order updates).
- KYC and compliance: verify identity where required by law.
- Improve the Service: analytics, crash reports, performance monitoring.
- Provide customer support and respond to inquiries.
- Security and fraud prevention.

3. Legal Basis for Processing (EEA Users)

Where applicable, our lawful basis for processing personal data includes: consent, contract performance, legal compliance, and legitimate interests (improving and securing the Service).

4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We may share data with third parties only as needed to operate the Service and as disclosed here:
- Hosting and storage: cloud providers (e.g., AWS S3, CloudFront) to store uploaded documents and assets.
- Payment processors: to process orders.
- Message/Notification providers: Twilio, email providers for transactional messages.
- Rate providers: third-party market data providers (rbgoldspot.com or similar) to fetch live silver rates.
- Analytics: optional analytics providers for usage statistics.
- Legal and compliance: to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests.

We will not sell personal information to third parties.

5. Data Retention

We retain personal data as long as needed to provide the Service, meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. Document images and KYC data are retained per applicable law or for as long as your account remains active and for a short period afterward unless a different retention period is required.

6. Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. These include TLS for data in transit, secure storage (S3 with restricted access), and access controls for the backend. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.

7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including: access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection. To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below. We may ask for information to verify your identity before processing requests.

8. Children

Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under this age. If we learn that a child under this age has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such information.

9. International Transfers

Our servers and third-party services may be located outside your country. When we transfer data internationally we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or rely on the data processor’s compliance.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top indicates when the policy was last revised. We will notify you of material changes via the app or by other means.
